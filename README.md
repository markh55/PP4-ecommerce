### Entity Relationship Diagram

Entity Relationship Diagram
Following on from designing the wireframes, I needed to think about a database structure to be used for the project. I opted for a comprehensive setup based around six core models: User, UserProfile, Order, Package, Review, and Rating.
The User model is composed of the following:

* ID (Primary Key)
* Username
* Email
* Password
* Date_joined

The UserProfile model is composed of the following:

* ID (Primary Key)
* User_id (Foreign Key)
* Default_phone_number
* Default_email
* Default_business_name

The Order model is composed of the following:

* ID (Primary Key)
* Order_number
* User_id (Foreign Key)
* Full_name
* Email
* Order_total
* Stripe_pid

The Package model is composed of the following:

* ID (Primary Key)
* Tier
* Name
* Slug
* Description
* Price
* Created_at

The Review model is composed of the following:

* ID (Primary Key)
* Package_id (Foreign Key)
* User_id (Foreign Key)
* Title
* Body

The Rating model is composed of the following:

* ID (Primary Key)
* Package_id (Foreign Key)
* User_id (Foreign Key)
* Rating
* Created_at

This structure allows for a one-to-one relationship between User and UserProfile, while enabling users to place multiple orders and create multiple reviews and ratings for different packages. Each package can have multiple reviews and ratings, keeping the relationships clear and easy to manage.

## Credits / Tutorials

### Newsletter
I used django-newsletter ([click here](https://dev.to/shubhamkshatriya25/how-to-build-a-email-newsletter-subscriber-in-django-j2p)) as a reference for the newsletter signup within the footer, and adapted the code to fit my project. This was just used as a guide.
